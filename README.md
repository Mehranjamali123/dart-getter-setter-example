# dart-getter-setter-example
 This repository contains a simple Dart application demonstrating the use of getters and setters.   The `Employ` class defines three properties: `id`, `name`, and `department`, each with a getter and setter. The example showcases how to use these properties by creating an instance of the `Employ` class, setting its values, and printing them.
